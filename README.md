# README:
This file is a quick manual for using the provided codes and input files in this repository


# Seismic_forward:

The run scripts are provided for forward modelling of seismic traveltimes with three applications:

- Straight_ray_tracing.m: Used for well-tie tomography modelling

- Refracted_ray_tracing.m: Used for tracing refracted models (only for shallow structures)

- Full_waveform.m: Quick script that is used to model full-waveform of reflection seismic datasets

# Gravity:

Gravity.m: is the main script to run, which generate the model grid and datasets files of Yamarna Terrane in WA. This includes:
- model and data grid file for input to Tomofast-x inversion platform (refer to:"Ogarko, Vitaliy, Jeremie Giraud, and Roland Martin. "Tomofast-x v1. 0 source code." Zenodo (2021).")
  and "Giraud, J., Ogarko, V., Martin, R., Jessell, M. and Lindsay, M., 2021. Structural, petrophysical, and geological constraints in potential field inversion using the Tomofast-x v1.
  0 open-source code. Geoscientific Model Development, 14(11), pp.6681-6709."
  
- forward modelling of gravity datasets

- Extract grid and model along seismic profiles



# Deep_learning: 

- Autoencoder.py: Quick CNN model for recreating seismic images from time to depth
  Forward_Noddy: Used on Noddy generated models to fast forward seismic and gravity datasets 
  (Refer to https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/14/381/2022/ for more information about Noddyverse datasets)
  
- input_mvcnn.py: This script has been generated to save required input files for CNN purposes for both seismic and gravity datasets


- For the mvcnn code we refer to the https://github.com/jongchyisu/mvcnn_pytorch which has been utilised for training 
  Input datasets for training before processing are available and could be accessed from: https://zenodo.org/record/7611550#.Y-DgAXbP2Hs.
  The trained models are provided in the input datasets directory of this repository


- Two notebooks: 1- load-model-2022-11-18.ipynb and 2 - test_samples.ipynb are used for loading the trained models and testing the trained networks respectively.
